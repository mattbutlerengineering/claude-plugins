# Tone Guidelines

Tone is how your words sound—the emotional quality and personality behind your message. The right tone makes users feel understood, supported, and confident. This guide helps you choose the appropriate tone for different contexts.

## The Three Core Tones

### 1. Friendly & Approachable

**When to use**:
- Onboarding new users
- Welcome messages and getting started flows
- Success states and celebrations
- Marketing and landing pages
- Community features (comments, sharing)
- Non-critical help content

**Characteristics**:
- Uses contractions ("We're", "You'll", "Don't")
- Conversational language (like talking to a friend)
- Personal pronouns ("we", "you")
- Positive, encouraging language
- Occasional warmth (without being unprofessional)
- Can include appropriate emoji in some contexts

**Examples**:

| Context | Friendly Tone |
|---------|--------------|
| Welcome message | "Welcome! We're excited to have you here. Let's set up your account—it'll only take a minute." |
| Success state | "You're all set! Your profile looks great." |
| Empty state | "Nothing here yet! Click 'Add Item' to get started." |
| Encouragement | "Almost there! Just one more step." |
| Getting started | "Let's build your first project together." |

**When to avoid**: Errors, security contexts, legal notices, high-stakes actions

### 2. Professional & Formal

**When to use**:

## Tone Combinations

You often need to blend tones. Here's how to mix them effectively:

### Friendly + Helpful
**Use for**: Helpful content in consumer products

"Looks like that page doesn't exist. Let's get you back on track—try searching or visit the homepage."

### Professional + Helpful
**Use for**: Enterprise errors, security issues

"Your session has expired for security reasons. Please sign in again to continue."

### Friendly + Professional
**Use for**: B2B onboarding, professional tools

"Welcome to the team! We've created your workspace and you're ready to start collaborating."

---

## Tone by Context

### Onboarding & First-Time Use
**Tone**: Friendly & Helpful

**Goals**: Make users feel welcome, reduce anxiety, encourage exploration

**Examples**:
- "Welcome! Let's personalize your experience. This will take about 2 minutes."
- "Great choice! Now let's set up your profile."
- "You're doing great—just one more step!"

**Avoid**:
- Being too formal: "Commence user initialization procedure"
- Being too casual: "Yo! Let's get this party started!"

---

### Success States & Confirmations
**Tone**: Friendly & Positive (but brief)

**Goals**: Celebrate user achievements, provide confidence

**Examples**:
- "Success! Your changes have been saved."
- "Welcome aboard! Your account is ready."
- "All done. We've sent you a confirmation email."
- "Perfect! Your photo has been uploaded."

**Avoid**:
- Over-celebrating: "OMG YESSS!!! YOU DID IT!!!"
- Being too dry: "Operation completed."

---

### Error Messages
**Tone**: Helpful & Calm (with empathy)

**Goals**: Reduce frustration, provide clear solutions, maintain trust

**Structure**: [What happened] + [Why] + [What to do]

**Examples**:
- "We couldn't save your changes. Your internet connection was lost. Please reconnect and try again."
- "This password is too common. Choose a more unique password to keep your account secure."
- "That link has expired. For security, links expire after 24 hours. Request a new one below."

**Avoid**:
- Blame: "You entered the wrong password"
- Robotic: "Error 404: Resource not found"
- Overly casual: "Oops! Something broke 😅"

---

### Warnings & Destructive Actions
**Tone**: Professional & Clear (with appropriate gravity)

**Goals**: Ensure users understand consequences, prevent mistakes

**Examples**:
- "Delete this project? This action cannot be undone. All files will be permanently deleted."
- "You're about to remove 3 team members. They'll lose access to all project files immediately."
- "Changing this setting will log you out of all devices for security."

**Avoid**:
- Being too casual: "Sure you wanna delete this?"
- Being alarming: "WARNING! DANGER! DELETE OPERATION!"
- Being vague: "Are you sure?"

---

### Empty States
**Tone**: Friendly & Encouraging

**Goals**: Explain why it's empty, encourage first action

**Examples**:
- "No projects yet. Create your first project to get started."
- "Your inbox is empty—you're all caught up!"
- "You haven't added any team members. Invite your team to start collaborating."

**Avoid**:
- Negative framing: "You have nothing here"
- Too robotic: "No items found"

---

### Help & Educational Content
**Tone**: Helpful & Clear

**Goals**: Teach without patronizing, enable self-service

**Examples**:
- "To invite team members, click 'Share' in the top right, then enter their email addresses."
- "Your password must be at least 8 characters and include a number. This keeps your account secure."
- "Can't find what you're looking for? Try using keywords or filter by date."

**Avoid**:
- Patronizing: "This is very simple, even a child could do it"
- Too technical: "Utilize the collaborative interface paradigm"

---

### Loading States & Wait Times
**Tone**: Calm & Informative

**Goals**: Set expectations, reduce anxiety during waits

**Examples**:
- "Uploading your file... This may take a minute."
- "Generating your report... Hang tight!"
- "Processing payment... Please don't close this window."

**Avoid**:
- Vague: "Loading..."
- Overly chatty: "We're working super duper hard on this!"

---

## Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** is your brand's consistent personality.
**Tone** is how that voice changes based on context.

Think of voice as a person's personality, and tone as their mood in different situations:

- **Voice**: "We're friendly and approachable"
  - **Tone in onboarding**: "Welcome! Let's get started."
  - **Tone in error**: "We couldn't process that. Let's try again."
  - **Tone in deletion**: "This will permanently delete your account."

The voice stays friendly, but the tone adjusts from excited to helpful to serious.

---

## Cultural Considerations

Tone can be interpreted differently across cultures:

### Humor
- **Use cautiously**: Humor doesn't always translate
- **Safe**: Gentle, universal humor
- **Risky**: Sarcasm, cultural references, wordplay

### Formality
- Some cultures expect more formal language
- "Please" and "thank you" may be required in some markets
- First names vs. last names vary by culture

### Directness
- Western cultures often prefer direct communication
- Some Asian cultures prefer more indirect language
- Adjust based on your audience

## Tone Testing Checklist

When reviewing your copy, ask:

**Is the tone appropriate?**
- [ ] Does it match the context (onboarding, error, success)?
- [ ] Does it match the severity (low stakes vs. high stakes)?
- [ ] Would I use this tone speaking to someone in person?

**Is it empathetic?**
- [ ] Does it acknowledge how the user might feel?
- [ ] Does it avoid blame or making users feel stupid?
- [ ] Does it show you care about their experience?

**Is it helpful?**
- [ ] Does it provide value (information, guidance, reassurance)?
- [ ] Does it tell users what to do next?
- [ ] Does it reduce anxiety or confusion?

**Is it on-brand?**
- [ ] Does it sound like "us"?
- [ ] Does it match our voice guidelines?
- [ ] Would our target audience connect with this?

## Examples: Same Message, Different Tones

**Context**: User's password is incorrect

**Friendly**: "That password doesn't match. Give it another try or reset your password below."

**Professional**: "The password you entered is incorrect. Please try again or use the password reset option."

**Helpful**: "We couldn't sign you in because your password is incorrect. Double-check your password or click 'Forgot password' to reset it."

**Too casual** (avoid): "Nope! Wrong password buddy 😅"

**Too robotic** (avoid): "Authentication failed. Error code: AUTH_001"

**Too formal** (avoid): "The credentials you have provided do not match our records. Please re-enter your credentials or initiate the password recovery process."

---

## Summary

Choose your tone based on:
1. **Context**: What's the user doing? (onboarding, encountering error, deleting data)
2. **Emotion**: How might they feel? (excited, confused, anxious)
3. **Stakes**: How serious is the situation? (low stakes = friendly, high stakes = professional)
4. **Brand**: Does this match your voice?

When in doubt, err on the side of helpful and clear over clever and casual.
