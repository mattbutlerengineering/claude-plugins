## Step 1: Clarity Check

Users should immediately understand what you're communicating.

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Is the message immediately understandable?**
  - Can a first-time user grasp the meaning in 2-3 seconds?
  - Is there any ambiguity or confusion?

- [ ] **Is it written in active voice?**
  - Does the text clearly show who is doing what?
  - Example: "Click Save" (active) vs "Changes will be saved" (passive)

- [ ] **Does it use second person (you/your)?**
  - Is the text speaking directly to the user?
  - Example: "Your account" vs "The user's account"

- [ ] **Is it free of jargon and technical terms?**
  - Are all terms appropriate for your audience?
  - Are technical terms defined if necessary?

- [ ] **Is each sentence focused on one idea?**
  - Can long sentences be split into shorter ones?
  - Is important information front-loaded?

### Common Clarity Issues:

**Passive voice**:
- Before: "Your file has been deleted"
- After: "We deleted your file"

**Third person instead of second person**:
- Before: "Users can download reports"
- After: "You can download reports"

**Jargon or technical terms**:
- Before: "Authenticate credentials to proceed"
- After: "Sign in to continue"

**Multiple ideas in one sentence**:
- Before: "Click Save to save your changes and close this window and return to the dashboard"
- After: "Click Save to save your changes and return to the dashboard"

---

## Step 2: Brevity Check

Every word should serve a purpose.

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Can any words be removed without losing meaning?**
  - Look for filler words: very, really, actually, just, simply, basically
  - Look for redundant phrases: "free gift", "past history", "end result"

- [ ] **Is the text as concise as possible?**
  - Can you say the same thing in fewer words?
  - Are you repeating information unnecessarily?

- [ ] **Are there any redundant phrases?**
  - "Please click on the button" → "Click the button"
  - "At this point in time" → "Now"

- [ ] **Does it fit length guidelines for its type?**
  - Buttons: <80 characters
  - Tooltips: <150 characters
  - Error messages: 1-3 sentences

### Common Brevity Issues:

**Unnecessary words**:
- Before: "Simply click on the button below to save your changes"
- After: "Click Save to save your changes"

**Redundant phrases**:
- Before: "Please enter in your email address"
- After: "Enter your email address"

**Too wordy for button**:
- Before: "Click here to continue to the next step"
- After: "Continue"

**Verbose error message**:
- Before: "We're sorry, but it appears that the email address you entered is not formatted correctly according to standard email format requirements"
- After: "Please enter a valid email address, like name@example.com"

---

## Step 3: Tone Check

Tone should match the context and be appropriate for the situation.

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Is the tone appropriate for the context?**
  - Onboarding: Friendly and encouraging
  - Errors: Calm and helpful
  - Deletion/high-stakes: Professional and clear
  - Success: Positive and brief

- [ ] **Is it empathetic (especially for errors)?**
  - Does it acknowledge the user's situation?
  - Does it show understanding and care?

- [ ] **Does it match the product voice?**
  - Is the tone consistent with your brand?
  - Is it aligned with your style guide?

- [ ] **Does it avoid blame or negative framing?**
  - Are you making the user feel at fault?
  - Can you reframe positively?

### Common Tone Issues:

**Wrong tone for context**:
- Before (error): "Whoops! That totally didn't work! 😅"
- After: "We couldn't process your request. Please try again."

**Not empathetic enough**:
- Before: "Invalid password"
- After: "Your password is incorrect. Please try again or reset your password."

**Blame or negative framing**:
- Before: "You entered the wrong email"
- After: "This email format isn't recognized. Please use format like name@example.com"

**Too casual for high-stakes action**:
- Before: "Wanna delete your account? This can't be undone!"
- After: "Delete your account? This action is permanent and cannot be undone."

---

## Step 4: Actionability Check

Users should always know what to do next.

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Does the user know what to do next?**
  - Is the next action clear?
  - Are there multiple possible actions? Which is primary?

- [ ] **Are calls-to-action specific and clear?**
  - Do buttons start with verbs?
  - Do they describe the specific action that will happen?

- [ ] **Are verbs strong and direct?**
  - "Delete account" vs "OK"
  - "Save changes" vs "Submit"

- [ ] **Are next steps provided for errors?**
  - Structure: [What happened] + [Why] + [What to do]
  - Does the error tell users how to fix it?

### Common Actionability Issues:

**Vague CTA**:
- Before: "OK"
- After: "Save changes"

**Not specific enough**:
- Before: "Continue"
- After: "Save and continue"

**No next steps in error**:
- Before: "Connection failed"
- After: "We couldn't connect to the server. Check your internet connection and try again."

**Weak verb**:
- Before: "Access dashboard"
- After: "Go to dashboard" or "Open dashboard"

---

## Step 5: Accessibility Check

Text should be readable and inclusive for all users.

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Is it written in plain language?**
  - 8th-grade reading level or below
  - Sentences under 25 words
  - Common words instead of fancy synonyms

- [ ] **Is it inclusive and gender-neutral?**
  - Uses "they/them" instead of "he/she"
  - Avoids gendered job titles
  - Avoids ableist language

- [ ] **Is it readable by screen readers?**
  - Are links descriptive out of context?
  - Does it avoid relying solely on color?
  - Does it avoid unnecessary directional language?

- [ ] **Will it work for international audiences?**
  - Avoids region-specific references
  - Uses clear date/time formats
  - Avoids idioms and cultural references

### Common Accessibility Issues:

**Too complex**:
- Before: "Utilize your credentials to authenticate"
- After: "Sign in with your email and password"

**Not gender-neutral**:
- Before: "Ask your salesman for help"
- After: "Ask your sales representative for help"

**Non-descriptive link**:
- Before: "To learn more, click here"
- After: "Learn more about privacy settings"

**Idiom**:
- Before: "Back to square one"
- After: "Start over"

---

## Step 6: Consistency Check

Text should match the patterns and terminology used elsewhere in the product.

### Questions to Ask:

- [ ] **Does it use consistent terminology?**
  - Is this the same word you use for this concept elsewhere?
  - Check: "delete" vs "remove", "sign in" vs "log in"

- [ ] **Does capitalization match the style guide?**
  - Sentence case vs title case
  - Is it consistent with other similar elements?

- [ ] **Does it follow platform conventions?**
  - iOS: Sentence case, "Delete" for destructive actions
  - Android: Sentence case
  - Web: Check your design system

### Common Consistency Issues:

**Inconsistent terminology**:
- Page 1: "Sign in"
- Page 2: "Log in"
- → Choose one and use consistently

**Inconsistent capitalization**:
- Button 1: "Save Changes" (title case)
- Button 2: "Delete account" (sentence case)
- → Use sentence case for all buttons

**Not following platform conventions**:
- iOS app using "Remove" when Apple guidelines say "Delete"
- → Use "Delete" on iOS

## Review Summary

After working through all steps, summarize your findings:

### Issues Found:
- List specific problems you identified

### Recommended Changes:
- Provide specific improvements with before/after examples

### Severity:
- **High**: Confusing, misleading, or inaccessible
- **Medium**: Could be clearer or more helpful
- **Low**: Minor improvements for polish

---

## Example Review

**Original text**: "Click OK to proceed to the next page"

**Review findings**:

**Step 1 - Clarity**: ✓ Clear
**Step 2 - Brevity**: ✗ "Click" is redundant (users know buttons are clickable), "to proceed to the next page" is wordy
**Step 3 - Tone**: ✓ Appropriate
**Step 4 - Actionability**: ✗ "OK" is vague, doesn't describe the action
**Step 5 - Accessibility**: ✓ Simple and clear
**Step 6 - Consistency**: ? (Check if other buttons use "OK" or specific verbs)

**Issues found**:
- Redundant word "Click"
- Vague CTA "OK"
- Wordy phrase "proceed to the next page"

**Recommended change**: "Continue" or "Save and continue" (if saving is part of the action)

**Severity**: Medium (works but could be much clearer and more actionable)
